# Hello, world!

My name is Tiago Donato, I'm a Communications professional based in Kansas City, Missouri. I specialize in video production and technology, and my background has been mainly in the nonprofit sector. Thank you for coming to my page.

For this website, I am working on a Jekyll template where I will blog and also keep an archive of reports on software applications such as organization and productivity tools, specialized video post-production tools, non-linear editors, file management, backup tools and more. You will also find plenty of info about privacy- and security-focused applications. My aim with that will be to share what I've learned over time in my work trying to find the best ways to do the things that I've needed to do. I will do my best to keep this data up to date.

If you'd like to get in touch, I'm at tiago@tgdnt.me
